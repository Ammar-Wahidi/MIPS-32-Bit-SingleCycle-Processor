# MIPS 32 Bit SingleCycle Processor
This project implements a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor in Verilog. It supports all R-type, I-type, and J-type instructions as defined in Appendix B. Includes a Dadda multiplier and a non-restoring divider for signed operations. Based on Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris &amp; Harris.
