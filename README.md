# MIPS 32‚ÄëBit Single‚ÄëCycle Processor

## üß© Project Overview

This project presents a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor implemented in Verilog. Designed with a modular and scalable architecture, it supports a wide range of MIPS instructions across R-type, I-type, and J-type formats. The processor executes each instruction in a single clock cycle, following the Harvard architecture model with separate instruction and data memories.

Key design components include a centralized control unit, ALU, register file, memory modules, and a structured datapath. To ensure functional accuracy, the design is rigorously verified using a suite of testbenches and real-world benchmark programs such as factorial, GCD, and others. The processor is well-suited for both educational purposes and as a foundation for more advanced pipelined or multi-cycle architectures.

## Architecture

- **Single‚ÄëCycle Datapath**: Fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write‚Äëback in one cycle.
- **Harvard Architecture**: Separate instruction and data memories.
- **Control Unit**: Main, ALU decoder and Branch modules.

## üéõÔ∏è Control Signals

Detailed information about the MIPS instruction formats, control signals, and ALU operation codes is provided in this Excel sheet I made :

üëâ [`MIPS ISA & Control Unit.xlsx`](https://github.com/Ammar-Wahidi/MIPS-32-Bit-SingleCycle-Processor/blob/main/My%20Architecture/ISA%20and%20Control%20Unit/MIPS%20ISA%20%26%20Control%20Unit.xlsx)

This spreadsheet includes:

- **MIPS ISA reference**: Opcodes, funct fields, and instruction classifications (R, I, J types)  
- **Main Control Signals**: Signal values (RegDst, ALUSrc, MemtoReg, etc.) for each instruction  
- **ALU Control Signals**: Function-to-operation mappings  
- **Truth Tables**: Control logic for main decoder and ALU decoder  

This file was used to guide the development of key modules like `Control_Unit.v`, `Main_Decoder.v`, `ALU_Decoder.v`

## üìä Benchmarks, Testbenches, Simulation & Results

in the **factorial benchmark**, the simulation concludes when the value `0xD08E` is written into register `$s0`.  
This specific moment is **highlighted with a red circle** in the waveform image.
