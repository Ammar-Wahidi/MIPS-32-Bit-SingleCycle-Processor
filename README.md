# MIPS 32‚ÄëBit Single‚ÄëCycle Processor

## üß© Project Overview

This project presents a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor implemented in Verilog. Designed with a modular and scalable architecture, it supports a wide range of MIPS instructions across R-type, I-type, and J-type formats. The processor executes each instruction in a single clock cycle, following the Harvard architecture model with separate instruction and data memories.

Key design components include a centralized control unit, ALU, register file, memory modules, and a structured datapath. To ensure functional accuracy, the design is rigorously verified using a suite of testbenches and real-world benchmark programs such as factorial, GCD, and others. The processor is well-suited for both educational purposes and as a foundation for more advanced pipelined or multi-cycle architectures.

## Architecture

- **Single‚ÄëCycle Datapath**: Fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write‚Äëback in one cycle.
- **Harvard Architecture**: Separate instruction and data memories.
- **Control Unit**: Main, ALU decoder and Branch modules.
